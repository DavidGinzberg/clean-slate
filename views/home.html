            Expunge DC is a tool to help you find out whether you can get your records expunged/sealed. 
            Before starting, try to have the date of your conviction and the crime you were committed of/charged with available. 
            We&rsquo;ll help you figure out the rest.

            Expunge DC is not an official website of the DC government or its courts. 
            We cannot process expungements, access court records, offer official legal advice, or file claims on your behalf. 
            We can link you to forms and answer key questions about your eligibility.
